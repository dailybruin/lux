# Contributing Guidelines

Lux follows the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). This can be easily done by running `yarn commit` instead of `git commit`.

To work on an issue, assign it to yourself and create a new branch with the following name: `<your-name>/<short-descriptive-issue-name>`. Feel free to commit away. Create a pull request when it is ready your branch is ready to be merged in.
