Lux is the Daily Bruin's design system.

In 1947, UC Berkeley provost Monroe E. Deutsch, [wrote the following](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40220704) on the appointment of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the president of Columbia University:

> The present trend will inevitably mean in time the transformation of our universities and colleges into something far removed
> from such mottoes as Veritas and Let There Be Light...
> We must be on our guard lest we surrender these precious characteristics of a true university sity, and make efficiency and, it may be, conformity replace them.
> Eternal vigilance alone can protect our institutions of higher learning in the performance of their indespensible task in a free society.

The goal of Lux is to make this eternal vigilance easily accessible to all.
