Lux is the Daily Bruin's design system, for use in [React](https://reactjs.org) applications.

In 1947, UC Berkeley provost Monroe E. Deutsch, [wrote the following](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40220704) on the appointment of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the president of Columbia University:

> The present trend will inevitably mean in time the transformation of our universities and colleges into something far removed
> from such mottoes as Veritas and Let There Be Light...
> We must be on our guard lest we surrender these precious characteristics of a true university sity, and make efficiency and, it may be, conformity replace them.
> Eternal vigilance alone can protect our institutions of higher learning in the performance of their indespensible task in a free society.

The goal of Lux is to make this eternal vigilance easily accessible to all by compliing web best practices and commonly used news page components into an easy to use library.
